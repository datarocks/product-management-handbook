<p>Associate Product Manager is where some of us start our career as a product manager, and where we learn the core, tactical principles and skills of product management. It can also be thought of as &apos;Trainee Product Manager&apos; since it&apos;s a role for us to learn &apos;on the job&apos;. </p>
<p>Associate Product Manager/Trainee Product Manager is where we learn how to take a large vision and medium-sized missions, and work with a team to create and prioritise small, achievavle goals. And to help a team break these goals into small, actionable jobs to be done. The Product Owner role within the Scrum framework describes the tactical product management skills required within a development team and as such provides a helpful model or Associate Product Managers to work from.</p>
<p>Associate Product Managers may start with a general awareness of product management tactics but are expected to develop rapidly, gaining working-level skills (i.e. can genuinely add value to a team) within six to twelve-months (ideally). The Associate Product Manager and the host organisation both need to commit to learning and development if this is rapid development is to be feasible.</p>
<p>Good conditions for rapid development of an Associate Product Manager include:</p>
<ul>
<li>association with a Product Manager or Senior Product Manager, ideally the person who owns the overall vision for the product/service on which the Associate Product Manager is working</li>
<li>initially placement on a mature team, in the development phase (referred to as &apos;Beta&apos; within government services); Associates initially placed in the exploration phase (inquiries, discoveries, or alphas) may find this tricky, since even mature teams find this phase tricky</li>
<li>given the chance to rotate across teams on different product/services, for different users, in different phases of the product lifecycle (as their skills and confidence develops)</li>
<li>provided with regular coaching and mentoring (ideally having a 1:1 every fortnight), and able to access training and development quickly and easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to view Associate Product Managers as a large investment of time and effort in order to build excellent Product Managers as the future (rather than viewing them as a cheap version of a Product Manager).</p>
<p>The GOV.UK role description for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/associate-product-manager-skills-they-need/associate-product-manager-skills-they-need" target="_blank">Associate Product Managers</a> is great, clearly setting out expected skills, and the level of expertise required in each of these skills.</p>
