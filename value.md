# Product management is responsible for value

Our teams require at least three perspectives if they are to work well: **Value - Workflow - Quality**

This is true of delivery teams, management teams, and leadership teams.

Product management’s focus is optimising value, and so is most useful to an organisation when we are given responsibility for value. We need to understand workflow and quality but equally need to acknowledge that they are not our strengths and that others will be better at them than us. We’re only useful as a profession when we understand our relationship with other professions.
