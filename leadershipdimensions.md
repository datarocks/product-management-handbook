You need to be aware of all the dimensions of leadership and make sure theyâ€™re in balance. Georg Fasching is an executive coach who has developed a [leadership model](https://georgfasching.com/introducing-the-prime-leadership-model/) to help us find this balance.

Georg talks about what the dimensions mean in a general sense in his [introductory post](https://georgfasching.com/introducing-the-prime-leadership-model/); Scott Coler (Head of Product, Ministry of Justice) has personalised this model and attempted to contextualise for product management in his own team in [this post](http://scottcolfer.com/2018/01/29/leadership-dimensions.html).
