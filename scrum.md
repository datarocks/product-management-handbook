# Make use of the Scrum framework

The [Scrum framework](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) takes the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and interprets it as a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. Scrum was published in 2002 by some of the authors of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. The [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) is published online. 

The Scrum framework is helpful for Trainee/Associate Product Managers because it:

- is lightweight and easy to understand
- requires a Product Manager to be a key member of a Scrum team (it calls this person a ‘Product Owner’)
- explains the point of a Product Owner, and how the Product Owner works with the teams though artifacts (like the backlog) and ceremonies (like review).

Here are some key sections of the Scrum Guide for product managers:

- [The Product Owner](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-po)
- [The Sprint](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-sprint)
- [Sprint Planning](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-planning)
- [Daily Scrum](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-daily)
- [Sprint Review](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-review)
- [Sprint Retrospective](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-retro)
- [Product Backlog](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog)
- [Sprint Backlog](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-sprintbacklog)
- [Increment](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-increment)
- [Definition of Done](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifact-transparency-done).

Two key ceremonies for product managers are sprint planning and sprint review:

- Product Managers/Product Owners are accountable for sprint reviews (with support from our Scrum Master/Delivery Manager and the rest of the team)
- Scrum Master/Delivery Managers are accountable for sprint planning (with support from the entire team, including us).

There is a _lot_ written about Scrum.
