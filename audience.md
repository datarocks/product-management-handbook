# Who is this handbook for?

This is intended for government digital services. It'll probably be a close-fit for UK product management communities working to the [digital, data and technology role description](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#product-and-delivery:-product-manager) but will hopefully be of use for local authorities and international government digital services too. Shout if you find it to be of use in any other settings.

Please consider improve the value of the handbook - we only know what we know, so it’d be great to get the insight of others. Please comment on this document if you spot a way to improve it. This could be something you find helpful that you’d like to add, or a refinement to something already in here. Anything that you think will make it more valuable. You can comment and suggest improvements via [Github](https://github.com/scottcolfer/product-management-handbook).
