# Keep being brilliant at the basics

You should be brilliant at the basics of product management tactics and strategy learned to this point in your career. The skills you learn as an Associate Product Manager and Product Manager provide you with the all the basics you need as a product leader - your challenge is to apply them at scale, in abstract settings.

The training available to you may become narrower as your expertise develops, with general courses diminishing in value (except as an occasional refresher). A few learning providers offer training for more senior product managers looking to develop their expertise:

[Mind the Product Training](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/product-management-training/): Mind the Product is the largest and oldest community for product managers and began offering training in 2017. Mind the Product Training offers courses in topics like user story mapping, product roadmapping, stakeholder mapping for product leaders, visual thinking for product people, continuous product discovery, and user research interviews.

[Jam Workshops](https://www.jamlondon.io/workshops): Jam is an annual product conference and like Mind the Product they have started offering training. Current workshops include ‘design sprints done right’, and ‘using jobs to be done for better product strategy’. 

[General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education?format=classes-workshops): You may wish to increase your awareness of how other professions in your team function, and General Assembly has a range of classes and workshops that may be of use.
