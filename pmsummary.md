# The Product Manager role develops the strategic principles and skills of product management

Product Manager is where we step-up and develop the strategic skills of product management, having developed our tactical skills in something like an Associate Product Manager role. We are often responsible for the overall value improvement of a feature of a public service (often a software feature), or (more rarely) an end-to-end public service or staff service. 

Product Managers take responsibility for broader product strategy by defining the problem statement and value proposition, building a vision for an improved, future value proposition, and creating the strategy for how to get there. We may provide this product strategy to an Associate Product Manager, who will help the team to figure out what this looks like in practice, and provide challenge where needed.

The GOV.UK role description for [Product Managers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/product-manager-skills-they-need/product-manager-skills-they-need) is great, clearly setting out expected skills, and the level of expertise required in each of these skills.
