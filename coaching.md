# Develop expertise in teaching, mentoring, coaching and facilitation

The value of product management expertise, business strategy and digital transformation is often released via ‘soft skills’ such as mentoring and teaching, coaching and facilitating. Delivery Managers may often be the experts in these skills within our teams, but the skills remain important for product managers too.

**Teaching** - The ability to offer the right knowledge, at the right time, taught in the right way, so that individuals, teams and organisations use the knowledge for their best benefit.

**Mentoring** - The ability to impart your experience, knowledge and guidance to help develop other product managers.

**Coaching** - The ability to act as a non-directive coach (with the coachee’s interest determining the direction, rather than your own expertise or opinion).

**Facilitation** - The ability to act as a neutral process holder, guiding and individual’s/team’s/organisation’s process of discovery, holding them to their purpose and definition of success.

There are many resources out there to help with developing our expertise when it comes to teaching, mentoring, coaching and facilitating, but these are particularly valuable:
