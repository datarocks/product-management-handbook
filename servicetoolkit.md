# Make use of the Government Service Toolkit

Many of us work joined the Civil Service to work on public services because of the mission set by the [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/), to build public services so good that people want to use them.
The Government Digital Service (GDS) has turned this mission in to a toolkit that has been adopted across government, and gives us the space to improve the lives of the public by focussing on their needs.

GDS took [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) and adapted it for the context of working on public services within the Civil Service. The Lean Startup provides a scientific approach to creating and managing new products and services in order to get those products/services into users' hands faster. In turn, the Lean Startup is based on [lean manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing), [design thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking), [customer development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_development), and [agile software development](http://agilemanifesto.org/).
GDS took all of this and created the [Government Service Toolkit](https://www.gov.uk/service-toolkit). The Government Service Toolkit is a great shorthand for what Lean Startup, lean manufacturing, design thinking, customer development, and agile development means when working on public services. It's a great tool for us all but particuarly useful for Associate Product Managers looking for a practical way to begin their development.

Key sections of the Government Service Toolkit include:

- [Government design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles) - including the famous '[start with user needs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#start-with-user-needs)'
- [Digital service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) - the 18-point standard that government services must meet
- [Service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual), guidance on how to research - design and build services that meet the Digital Service Standard
    - this includes the common phases of agile government service development: [discovery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works) - test your assumptions about the problem; [alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) - testing assumptions about the solution and looking for problem/solution fit; [beta](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works) - build the thing and test it works; [live](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-live-phase-works) - test that the thing you built is being used, is useful, and it can can have its value continually optimised; [retirement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/retiring-your-service) - stop a thing because it's no longer being used or no longer useful (or both).
    - the type of [team](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team) we're often a part of
- [Service assemssment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments), [what happens at a service assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work), and [checking if you need a service assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment)
- [Technology code of practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice) - the set of criteria to help government design, build and buy better technology.
