# Make promises to solve problems, not commitments to specific solutions and features

Focussing on problems is what helps us to do the least work possible to meet the needs of users. If we really understand users’ problem and are usefully agnostic about solutions then we can be flexible enough to always do the least work possible to meet our users’ needs.

### A gap in the market does not always mean there’s a market in the gap

Identifying a problem is not sufficient, we need to make sure that it’s a problem worth solving for our users. As product managers, we need to help our teams continually ask these questions about the problem we want to solve:

- Is it pervasive? Who specifically has the problem and does it affect lots of people?
- Is it urgent? Do those people need the problem to be solved right away or can they wait?
- Is it complex? Are people able to solve the problem for themselves or do they need someone else to solve it for them?
- Is it valuable for users? How painful is the problem for them and would they be willing to change their behaviour and use a new or different solution?
- Is it valuable for your organisation? Will solving the problem save more money than it costs to build the solution?

We have a compelling problem when you can answer ‘yes’ to all of these questions.

We are likely to reframe our problem several times during the product lifecycle and may even change our primary user. This is important and valuable as we refine the scope of our problem to be feasible to solve. We’ll often find that we start with a massive problem space and refine this to something with a narrower focus but greater feasibility of being solved. We might find that the problem is not ready to be solved and that we need to pause or cancel our product/service.

### Problem/solution fit

We can start looking for the right solution once we understand our problem, with the goal of achieving ‘product/solution fit’. The Design Council has famously used a ‘double diamond’ diagram to explain how we initially find problem/solution fit, and Jock Busuttil has refined it further.

### Always be optimising value

Our job as product managers is to work with our teams to continually optimise the value of our products and services - by ensuring that we keep and improve our problem/solution fit for our users - through the minimum, viable product possible. This is the goal of every iteration of our product/services. How do we do that?

We have some key tools that help us with our product strategy:

A problem statement should form the initial leap of faith for every product idea, then be refined and improved throughout the life of our products/services. Melanie Cannon from DWP has written helpful guidance on how to write a problem statement.

Value proposition, business model canvas, product vision, and product roadmap are some of the most critical strategic tools we use day to day:

- a value proposition is where our organisation's offer meets with our users' needs, explaining how our solutions fit with users' problems - a [value proposition canvas](https://strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas) is a tool that can help to create a value proposition
- a business model canvas describes how 'profitable' your value proposition is today, defining it in terms of value and cost - it looks at the overall operating model and helps us understand opportunities to optimise value - a [business model canvas](https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) is a tool to help create a business model
- a product vision describes our goal in terms of the value of the product/service in the future - the estimated value the product will have in the future should justify the invesment of money, time and effort that we want to make - a [product vision board](https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/vision-board/) is a tool to help us create a vision
- a product roadmap describes the steps needed to be taken from today (as described in the business model canvas) to the future (as described in the vision) - the roadmap makes promises to solve problems, not commitment to solutions or features - it is a flexible planning tool that should be reviewed and updated regularly as we learn more about our product/service

We should run a regular product strategy meeting to review all of the above (in addition to the teams more frequent sprint ceremonies).
